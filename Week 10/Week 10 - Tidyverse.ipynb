Therefore, if you read a code snippet and there is no other context to indicate you are working with data.tables and try to apply the code to a data.frame it may fail or produce unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are some of the practical differences? Here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Much faster and very intuitive by operations\n",
    "* You won't accidentally print out a huge data.frame with the need to press Ctrl-C, data.table prevents this sort of accident\n",
    "* Faster and better file reading with fread\n",
    "* The package also provides a number of other utility functions, like %between% or rbindlist that make life better\n",
    "* Pretty much faster for a lot of basic operations, since a lot of data.frame operations copy the entire thing needlessly\n",
